# Low Earth Orbit Satellite Network Topology Design

This Python package was created by Millicent Riordan for their third-year project *Designing High-Performance
Inter-Satellite Link Topologies for Satellite Megaconstellations* at Durham University. 

## Set-Up

### System

1. Python version 3.11+
2. To ensure full operation, recommended operating systems include recent versions of Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 18+, similar to the Hypatia simulation software) or macOS 14+ (Sonoma onwards).

### Python Dependencies

Dependencies for this package include the Python libraries: `astropy`, `certifi`, `ephem`, `networkx`, `numpy`, `nx-parallel`, `pytest`, `scipy`, `sgp4`, `skyfield`, and `sphinx`. 

```astropy``` ```certifi``` ```configobj``` ```ephem``` ```geopandas``` ```matplotlib``` ```networkx``` ```numpy``` ```plotly``` ```pytest``` ```scipy``` ```sgp4``` ```skyfield``` ```sphinx```

To install all dependencies automatically, run ```bash install_dependencies.sh```.

## Modules and Functionality

This package involves numerous functions that are grouped as follows:

- `analysis` - this module provides function that allow the user to evaluate (and record results of such evaluation) 
topologies according to various metrics. Furthermore, the topologies analysed can be built with various methods, such 
as various DCMST construction methods. This module also provides a visualisation function that allows user to view their
topology and simulate satellites moving around the Earth.
- `cost_function_optimisation_algorithms` - this module provides different methods for optimising the cost function 
weights of the novel algorithm proposed in the final paper. These methods include a randomised search, evolutionary 
strategy search, and a machine learning-based search. 
- `data_handling` - this module provides basic data handling functions (i.e. methods to read satellite description data,
save the topologies generated by functions in `satellite_topology_construction_algorithms`, and save the results of 
optimisation functions).
- `dcmst_construction_algorithms` - this module provides functions for constructing degree-constrained minimum spanning 
trees (see report for full description). 
- `metrics` - this module provides functions that will calculate various metrics given a graph-representation of a 
satellite network, such as the average hop count, propagation delay, and link churn.
- `satellite_network_attribute_functions` - this module allows a user to determine various network attributes, such as 
the visibility between pairs of satellites, the cost function used by the novel algorithm, and whether satellites are 
more vulnerable to solar flares.
- `satellite_topology_construction_algorithms` - this module provides various functions for constructing topologies of 
given satellite networks. As well as the novel algorithm proposed in the report, +Grid and MDTD topology construction algorithms are provided
- `tests` - this module provides unit and integration tests for all the modules listed above.

More information about the purpose of each function is provided in the documentation of this project, as well as the 
line by line comments within each function. Each module has been formatted according to PEP-8 standards.

## Recreating Report

To recreate the results in the project's final report, please ```cd project``` and run ```bash report.sh```. Please note that this script 
takes significant execution time. However, a large proportion of this code is automatically parallelised -  if you have 
access to a significant number of CPU cores, this code will run significantly faster over several days. To generate an overview of the results
of ```report.sh```, run ```results.sh``` to build a csv file.
