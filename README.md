# Low Earth Orbit Satellite Network Topology Design

This Python package was created by Millicent Riordan for their final third-year project *Designing High-Performance
Inter-Satellite Link Topologies for Satellite Megaconstellations* at Durham University. 

## Set-Up

### System

1. Python version 3.11+
2. To ensure full operation, recommended operating systems include recent versions of Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 18+, similar to the Hypatia simulation software) or macOS 14+ (Sonoma onwards).

### Python Dependencies

Dependencies for this package include the Python libraries: `astropy`, `certifi`, `ephem`, `networkx`, `numpy`, `nx-parallel`, `pytest`, `scipy`, `sgp4`, and `skyfield`. 

To install all dependencies automatically, please run `bash install_dependencies.sh` if you wish to install on a macOS system or `bash install_dependencies_linux.sh` if you wish to install on a Linux-based system.

## Modules and Functionality

This package involves numerous functions that are grouped as follows:
